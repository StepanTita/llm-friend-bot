# GPT-2.5 LLM Friend 🤖 🧠

Harness the power of GPT-2.5, fine-tuned with personal Telegram chats to not just mimic a writing style but to infuse it with a touch of humor and mathematical prowess. Built on Python, this model utilizes the strengths of PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Overview 🌐

This project seeks to fine-tune the GPT-2.5 model with a personal touch. By training it on personal Telegram chats, we aim to capture the essence of individualized writing styles. To spice things up, we've also fed the model a sprinkle of anecdotes and a dash of math tasks. The result? A model with personality, humor, and the ability to crunch some numbers!
